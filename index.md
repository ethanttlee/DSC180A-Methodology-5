**Q: What is the most interesting topic covered in your domain this quarter?**

A: The most interesting topic so far this quarter related to gene analysis was certainly the application of eQTL (expression quantitative trait loci) analyses. Before this quarter, I had very limited exposure with any data analysis regarding DNA biological gene data, and the eQTL analyses were my first exposure to this. It was very enlightening to see how exactly the SNP human genome data could be correlated with other techniques and data to find valuable insights.

**Q: Describe a potential investigation you would like to pursue for your Quarter 2 Project.**

A: A potential investigation I would like to pursue for the Quarter 2 project would be the genetic risk for cancer, correlated versus various factors such as age, income, or gender. I specifically want to investigate how some of these extraneous factors, along with genetic data, can highlight insights on some of the developments of deadly diseases like cancer. With such research in the future, preventative measures can be taken to reduce the impact of deadly diseases, which can bring many benefits to our species.

**Q: What is a potential change you’d make to the approach taken in your current Quarter 1 Project?**

A: A change that I would potentially want to introduce into this quarter’s project would be the inclusion of factors outside of just the genetic data (SNPs, gene expression) including things like age or social status. I think insights like that can give us a lot more information to work with for analyses. I think that a look into the relationships between the gene data and something like social status could be particularly interesting in the context of our study.

**Q: What other techniques would you be interested in using in your project?**

A: Something that I think could potentially be applied to this project would be deep learning using neural networks. The main drawback of this is the enormous compute resources required, but otherwise I believe that neural networks would be able to find more complex associations between the vast amounts of eQTL and SNP data.
